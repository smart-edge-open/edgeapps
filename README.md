# OpenNESS Edge Applications
This repository presents reference designs of network & enterprise edge applications that have been deployed with the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) platform.

## Getting Started

If this is your first stop at OpenNESS project, feel free to familiarize yourself with [OpenNESS philosophy and architecture](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/architecture.md) and have a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/openness_releasenotes.md) to learn about the release history, fixed issues and compatible software/hardware.

To get started with OpenNESS installation, follow the steps in [the network edge getting started guide](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md) or [the on-premises getting started guide](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/getting-started/on-premises/controller-edge-node-setup.md) according to the desired deployment type. More information about the difference between the two deployment scenarios is provided in the [Deployment Scenarios](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/architecture.md#deployment-scenarios) section.

The edge applications provided in this repository are landed on OpenNESS which is described in the onboarding guides for [network edge deployment](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/applications-onboard/network-edge-applications-onboarding.md) and [on-premises deployment](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/applications-onboard/on-premises-applications-onboarding.md). It is advised that you practice with these onboarding guides in order to get a feel of how the edge apps are launched and operated in the OpenNESS environment.

The full documentation of the OpenNESS solution is accessible at the [OpenNESS index page](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/README.md).

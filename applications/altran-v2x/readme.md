Overview of Altran V2X Apps

Altran V2X solution enables safety & non-safety applications for V2V,V2I,V2P and V2N scenarios for Road Side Units (RSU), On Board Units (OBU) and Smart Pedestrian Devices . The solution comes with application and underlying stack conformant to regional standards - WAVE / ETSI and China.

V2X Application Description

Following Vehicle To Infrastructure (V2I) applications are supported:

* Roadside Alert (RSA) RSU periodically broadcast advisory messages about the road hazards (Slippery Road, Animal On the Road etc.)

* Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCSN) RSU periodically broadcast presence and occupancy status of nearby Electric changing station Information

* Vulnerable Road User (VRU) RSU detect vulnerable road user and broadcast the same information to near-by vehicles

* Time To Green (TTG) / Green Light Signal (GLOSA) RSU broadcast the traffic signals state and time information to near-by vehicles in an intersection

Separate container images are provided for OBU / RSU apps which can be onboarded (as pods) and communicate over UDP/IP interface. A Human Machine Interface (HMI) app is provided for visualization and demo purpose. In real deployment scenario the UDP/IP interface could be replaced by C-V2X PC5 or C-V2X Uu air interface

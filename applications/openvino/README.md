## OpenVINO Sample Application in OpenNESS

### Overview
This sample application demonstrates OpenVINO object detection (pedestrian and vehicle detection) deployment and execution on the OpenNESS edge platform.

- [OpenVINO Sample Application White Paper](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/applications/openness_openvino.md)
- [OpenVINO Sample Application Onboarding Guide - Network Edge](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/specs/blob/master/doc/applications-onboard/network-edge-applications-onboarding.md#onboarding-openvino-application)


### Troubleshooting

#### 1. After deployment, OpenVINO sample consumer keeps Crash with error: "proxyconnect tcp: dial tcp i/o timeout", and not able to recover after serveral times restart.

The issue is caused by proxy setting issue. Modify proxy setting when building image or Edit 'openvino-cons-app.yaml' with desired proxy setting as below:
```yaml
      containers:
        - name: openvino-cons-app
          image: openvino-cons-app:1.0
          imagePullPolicy: Never
          env:
          - name: https_proxy
            value: "<proxy>"

```

If the issue still exists, can try to re-deploy as below:
```shell
# kubectl delete -f openvino-cons-app.yaml
# kubectl delete csr openvino-cons-app
```

Then re-deploy after the consumer has been terminated completely (Use `kubectl get pods` to check termination status).  
#### 2. After deployment, Traffic from external server does not receive in Consumer pod.
Install tcpdump on controller.
Use command to capture log:
```shell
    kubectl ko tcpdump default/openvino-cons-app-xxxxÂ port 5000
```
Pod name could be got use below command:
```shell
    kubectl get po 
```    
Log should look like:
```log
06:59:57.086038 IP 192.168.1.10.58786 > 10.16.0.36.5000: Flags [P.], seq 1940984:1941120, ack 1, win 298, options [nop,nop,TS val 216647345 ecr 79868771], length 136

```
If no log, there should be no traffic data received by consumer, so pls check your network policy which allowing ingress traffic on port 5000 (tcp and udp) from 192.168.1.0/24 network to the OpenVINO consumer application pod as:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: openvino-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: openvino-cons-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5000
```
Or you could try to delete default block ingress policy:
```shell
    kubectl delete networkpolicies block-all-ingress
```
If data received after deleting the ingress policy, there should be something error in your network policy for consumer, please check and re-apply it. (block-all-ingress should not be deleted in production environment.)
### RTMP
In this example, we use rtmp protocol to replace the rtp protocol for transmission.
RTMP is the acronym for Real Time Messaging Protocol. The protocol is based on TCP and is a protocol family, including RTMP basic protocol and RTMPT/RTMPS/RTMPE and many other variants. RTMP is a network protocol designed for real-time data communication. It is mainly used for audio, video and data communication between the Flash/AIR platform and a streaming media/interactive server that supports the RTMP protocol.
RTP is based on the UDP protocol. RTP itself does not provide a timely delivery mechanism or other quality of service (QoS) guarantees. It relies on low-level services to achieve this process. RTP does not guarantee delivery or prevent out-of-order delivery, nor does it determine the reliability of the underlying network. The RTMP protocol is a protocol designed specifically for the efficient transmission of video, audio and data. It realizes real-time video and sound transmission by establishing a binary TCP connection or connecting an HTTP tunnel, and can guarantee the transmission quality (QoS).
